    <h1>SoBlay Server</h1>
    <p>This is the server for the upcoming SoBlay system.</p>
	<h2>What is SoBlay?</h2>
	<p>SoBlay is made to act and feel like the operating system you see<br/>
		on Sony Blu-ray players. SoBlay is still in development, so stay tuned!
	</p>
	<h2>What can I do with SoBlay?</h2>
	<p>Since SoBlay is meant to look and feel like the UI of the Sony Blu-ray players,<br />
	it functions pretty much similar. You can stream movies and TV shows with SoFlix, which is like<br />
	Netflix, all the time. Keep in mind that SoBlay and the SoFlix service are still in development,<br />
	so expect some things to change.<br />
